# CODSOFT-Task-4
This is my task-4 at Codsoft Internship which says to make a "Rock-Paper-Scissors" Game using Python

This is a game which prompts the user to choose rock,paper,or scissors.
Generates a random choice(rock,paper,or scissors)for the computer.
The Game logic is that it determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. Rock beats scissors,scissors beat paper,and paper beats rock.
It shows the user's choice and the computer's choice.Displays the result,whether the user wins,loses,or it's a tie.
Keeps track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.Also asks the user if they want to play another round.
